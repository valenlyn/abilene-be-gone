# What We Really Want

🤖 I'm extending this project as a Telegram bot, see it here: [What We Really Want (Telegram Bot)](https://github.com/valenlyn/abilene-telegram-bot). ✨

# Problem

[Abilene paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox): People collectively decide on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of many or all of the individuals in the group. It involves a common breakdown of group communication in which each member mistakenly believes that their own preferences are counter to the group's and, therefore, does not raise objections.

# Solution

A democratised polling system, where everyone is allowed to suggest options anonymously (as opposed to 1 person creating or collating options for the poll--not so anonymous), and every to express interest or disinterest (by reacting 🤮 "hate it" 😊 "like it" 😍 "love it") for other group members’ suggestions, also anonymously.

This way, members of the group are not at all led to believe that a suggestion given by another group member is well-liked, or feel compelled or pressured to accede to the suggestion.

## User story
As a family unit, I want this app so that we only do activities everyone is enthusiastic about.
